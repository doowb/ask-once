# ask-once [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/ask-once.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/ask-once)  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/doowb/ask-once.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/doowb/ask-once)

> Only ask a question one time and store the answer.

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```sh
$ npm i ask-once --save
```

## Usage

```js
var askOnce = require('ask-once');
```

## Examples

First time the program is run, the user is prompted to answer a question:

Additional runs of the program will skip prompting the user:

Passing the `init` option will delete all the stored answers and prompt the user to answer the question again:

Additional runs after clearing the stop will return the newly saved answer:

Passing the `force` option will force the question to be asked:
