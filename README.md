# ask-once [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/ask-once.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/ask-once)  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/doowb/ask-once.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/doowb/ask-once)

> Only ask a question one time and store the answer.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```sh
$ npm i ask-once --save
```

## Usage

```js
var ask = require('ask-once')();
```

**2. Ask a question!**

```js
ask.once('May I have your username?', function (err, answer) {
  console.log(answer);
});
```

The user's answer is saved, and the question won't be asked again unless:

* `force: true` is passed on the options, or
* the answer is deleted directly

## FAQ

**Where are the answers stored?**

The user's answers are saved on a global config store that is uniquely identified to the application using `ask-once`.

**Can I change where answers are stored?**

Yes, you can pass the name of a [data-store](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/data-store) with the `cwd` option set to whatever you want it to be. Here's an example:

```js
// pass the name of a data-store, so you can use
// whatever storage location you want
var ask = require('ask-once')({
  store: {
    name: 'foo',
    cwd: 'bar'
  }
});

ask.once('May I have your username?' function (err, answer) {
  console.log(answer);
});
```

## Docs

### options

First time the program is run, the user is prompted to answer a question:

Additional runs of the program will skip prompting the user:
